## What Is LiveMe Pro Tools?
Its an [Electron](https://electronjs.org) based application for Live.me Social Video network for:

## Prebuilt Releases (64-bit only!)

To download the latest prebuilt versions, [click here](/releases/latest).

**Current Supported Platforms (64-bit only):**
- Ubuntu-based Linux and Debian Distributions (64-bit)
- macOS v10.11 or higher (64-bit only!)
- Windows 7 or higher (64-bit!)

## 32-bit versions???

We only build 64-bit releases as pretty much all computers now run 64-bit OSes.  

If you need a 32-bit version, you will have to build it yourself.  Unfortunately, we do not offer any support for 32-bit versions.

## FFMPEG No Longer Required?
You can choose to use a basic built-in concat system now to join the chunks downloaded without needing to have FFMPEG installed on your computer.  Or for better support, you can still use FFMPEG settings.

If you wish to transcode the downloads, then you will need to have FFMPEG installed on your computer.
