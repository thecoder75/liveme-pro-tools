## 32-bit versions???

We only build 64-bit releases as pretty much all computers now run 64-bit OSes.  

If you need a 32-bit version, you will have to build it yourself.  Unfortunately, we do not offer any support for 32-bit versions.

## FFMPEG support removed

Due to code changes in v2.x, support for using FFMPEG for downloading or transcoding has been removed.
